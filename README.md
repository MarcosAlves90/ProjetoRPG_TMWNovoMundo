# The Mental World: Mind Illness

## Introduction

The Mental World: New World is a batch-first text RPG game, but
then ported to python for performance reasons and ease of development.
During the language transition, the original idea for the game was gradually
modified, especially with regard to history and game mechanics. These
changes were caused by using the game as my final project for the
Python for beginners on Codédex.

As I am Brazilian and not fluent in English, I had help from some
translators to translate the text into English. Please let me know if there is
some translation error. It is also possible that some commits or annotations
have been made in Brazilian Portuguese, but just ignore these little
details.

## The Game

At the beginning of the game you create your character, but then it is inserted into
a world he already knew, with secrets he keeps even from you.
The goal is to help him get on with his life as normal while he completes
missions involving a past he would like to forget.

The game takes place in a fictional region of Brazil called Agamemnon, which is located specifically in the state of São Paulo. The year is 2052, a dystopia
cyberpunk where technology is used to control the population and nature.
In this world there is a hidden force called energy, the most
basic of everything that exists. Humans who were born with the ability to
manipulate this energy are called "ultra-humans", and those who use it
control through training and combat styles, are called
"arcane wizards".

## The Code

The game code is divided between two files, 'config.py', used as
module to the main file, and 'tmw_nw.py', the main file. The 'config.py' file contains all the
default game settings, while 'tmw_nw.py' contains the main game code , such as functions and classes.

The game mainly uses functions to remain playable and infinite. The idea
It's not going very far with the project, just finishing it and publishing it on Codedex.
